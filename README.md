# Stream Bingo
Play Bingo with your favourite livestreamers!

## How to play
### For Streamers
- Open the board and input the `id` parameter into the URL with a number between `0` and `9999`
  - for example: https://streambingo.party/?id=69
- Share this board URL with your chat
  - it is recommended to have it on a timer or with a command so players can find it easily)
  - the streamer can also add the board as an overlay from a browser source (as it's perfectly square it's easy to crop)
- It is also recommended to create the !bingo command to help viewers declare bingo quickly!

### The Players (Viewers)
- Open the URL you got from the streamer (or their chat command)
- Pay close to attention to the stream - if something happens, make sure to check the board and mark the tile
- Let the streamer know in chat (either via command or otherwise) once you have completed a row **horizontally and/or vertically** ==> copy the full URL in your browser and send it to the streamer to be verified to win!

## Notes
- Currently there are 24 messages that can be randomised into hundreds of combinations. More messages will be added over time to allow for an even larger number of combinations!
