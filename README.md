# Stream Bingo
Play Bingo with your favourite livestreamers!

## How to play
- The streamer creates the board and shares the unique URL with their chat (and/or shows it on stream)
- The streamer can also add the bingo board as an overlay (optional)
- Each player opens the streambingo.party URL from the streamer
- As things occur on stream, the players mark the tiles for things that happened on stream
- Players type BINGO in chat once they have completed a row horizontally or vertically - copy your unique URL in your browser and send it to the streamer to be verified to win!

## Notes

- Currently there is only one static board. More boards will be added over time.
